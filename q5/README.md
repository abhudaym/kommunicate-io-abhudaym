## Answer:

I would like that both my batchmates can wear multiple hats, i.e, they can pick up different roles and help the company in their fields of expertise. My batchmates should have compulsorily a zeal for the startup and helping the community.

Since I am confident of my technical and analytical skills, firstly I would want to get someone who is good at handling business along with being good at technical side as well - probably as a business development manager. For this, I think my teammate from my volunteer group DSC SRM - Aryan would be the perfect fit.

Secondly, I would like to hire someone who can handle finances as well as marketing of the company which is very important in order for any company to grow. For this, I think my teammate from my volunteer group DSC SRM - Pratiksha would be the perfect fit.
