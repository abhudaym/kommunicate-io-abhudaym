# PrefabMart

### There have been a lot of interesting projects that I have worked on while at my internships. But out of my personal projects, my favourite is PrefabMart. PrefabMart was my submission to Azure Developer League 2021. With PrefabMart, we aimed to be the world's first online prefabricated structure selling platform.
